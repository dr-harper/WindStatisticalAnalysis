# Conference Papers

This repository contains the papers and supporting analysis which were completed within my PhD. 

## 	[Wind Statistical Analysis](01-StatisticalAnalysis)



Presented at *ECOS 2017 - The 30th International Conference on Efficiency, Cost, Optimization, Simulation and Environmental Impact of Energy Systems*.

This study has explored whether the planning success of proposed wind turbine projects can be predicted using a range of geospatial parameters based on Great Britain as a case study. Logistic regression is used to assess the relationship between appropriate variables and planning outcome.

## [Wind GIS-MCDA](02-GIS_MCDA)

Presented at *SET2017 - The 16th International Conference on Sustainabe Energy Technologies*

Building upon the analysis conducted in the Wind Statistical Analysis, a geospatial information system tool is designed to locate suitable locations for wind turbines.
