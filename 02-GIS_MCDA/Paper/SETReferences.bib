abstract = {Multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) is perhaps the most fundamental of decision support operations in geographical information systems (GIS). This paper reviews two mainMCE approaches employed in GIS, namely Boolean and Weighted Linear Combination (WLC), and discusses issues and problems associ- ated with both. To resolve the conceptualdi? erences between the two approaches, this paper proposes the application of fuzzy measures, a concept that is broader but that includes fuzzy set membership, and argues that the standardized factors ofMCE belong to a general class of fuzzymeasures and themore speci? c instance of fuzzy set membership. This perspective provides a strong theoretical basis for the standardization of factors and their subsequent aggregation. In this context, a new aggregation operator that accommodates and extends the Boolean and WLC approaches is discussed: the Ordered Weighted Average. A case study of industrial allocation in Nakuru, Kenya is employed to illustrate the di? erent approaches.},

abstract = {This paper aims to understand different outcomes of implementation of wind power deployment programmes. Geographical variables such as quantity of wind resources are in themselves insufficient to explain patterns of implementation of wind power. To enhance the review of the factors affecting wind power deployment we also made a systematic comparison of six country cases: Denmark, Spain, Germany, Scotland, the Netherlands, and England/Wales. The impact of four key institutional variables is examined and put into a scheme of a set of potential hypothesis about their inter-relationships. These are influenced by different national traditions: planning systems; financial support mechanisms; landscape protection organisations and patterns of ownership of wind power. (1) Planning systems, which favour wind power are essential, and in all cases national planning policies generally intend to support wind power development, but planning institutions show a wide variety with clear differences in implementation results. (2) Systems of financial support are also a sine qua non for development but they also vary in their effectiveness across country and time in the study. Robust and consistent support regimes in Denmark, Germany and Spain have speeded developments. (3) Landscape protection organisations vary in strength in a range between England/Wales (very strong and influential) to Spain (non-existent). Strong and effective opposition to wind developments is always primarily rooted in landscape values. (4) Local ownership patterns coincide with higher rates of wind power deployment than remote, corporate ownership. Local involvement recruits conditional support for projects and is related to traditions of energy activism. Such traditions are strongest in Denmark and Germany and weakest in Spain, England/Wales and Scotland. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The present study analyzed a multi-criteria decision support system to define wind energy resources in western Iran. Clean domestic renewable energy can be the best option in consideration of intense economic development and its accompanying increase in energy consumption. The most important barrier to wider deployment of renewable resources in Iran is the price of fossil fuels, which is the lowest in the world. The government has recently decided to remove subsidies for fossil fuel, meaning that its price will increase and will make the cost of green energies more attractive. Wind power is an option for improved economic conditions in the region and low environmental impacts. This study applied geographic information system to determine the potential of wind energy in Markazi province in western Iran. The multiple criteria decision making method and site selection criterion for wind resources assessment is explained and developed for the study area. Criteria of equal importance were investigated, including technical, environmental, economic and geographic standards. The results were favorable for electricity production in accordance with international standards from wind in western Iran. The results show that 28{\%} of the study area has capacity for installing large wind farms.},

abstract = {Twenty states plus the District of Columbia now have renewable portfolio standards (RPS) in place that requires a certain percentage of energy to come from renewable sources by a specific year. With renewable energy on the verge of massive growth, much research emphasis is put on enabling the implementation of these technologies. This paper presents a novel method of site selection for wind turbine farms in New York State, based on a spatial cost-revenue optimization. The algorithm used for this is built in ESRI ArcGIS Desktop 9.3.1 software and consists of three stages. The first stage excludes sites that are infeasible for wind turbine farms, based on land use and geological constraints. The second stage identifies the best feasible sites based on the expected net present value from four major cost and revenue categories that are spatially dependent: revenue from generated electricity, costs from access roads, power lines and land clearing. The third stage assesses the ecological impacts on bird and their habitats. The proposed spatial multi-criteria methodology is then implemented in New York State and the results were compared with the locations of existing wind turbine farms. The wind farm site selection tool presented in this paper provides insights into the most feasible sites for a large geographic area based on user inputs, and can assist the planning of wind developers, utilities, ISO's and State governments in attaining renewable portfolio standards. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Being cleaner and climate friendly, wind energy has been increasingly utilized to meet the ever-growing global energy demands. In the State of Nebraska, USA, a wide gap exists between wind resource and actual energy production, and it is imperative to expand the wind energy development. Because of the formidable costs associated with wind energy development, the locations for new wind turbines need to be carefully selected to provide the greatest benefit for a given investment. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) have been widely used to identify the suitable wind farm locations. In this study, a GIS-based multi-criteria approach was developed to identify the areas that are best suited to wind energy development in Northeast Nebraska, USA. Seven criteria were adopted in this method, including distance to roads, closeness to transmission lines, population density, wind potential, land use, distance to cities, slope and exclusionary areas. The suitability of wind farm development was modeled by a weighted overlay of geospatial layers corresponding to these criteria. The results indicate that the model is capable of identifying locations highly suited for wind farm development. The approach could help identify suitable wind farm locations in other areas with a similar geographic background.},

We decided to analyze the Federal State of Bavaria in Germany as its current policy governance decelerates the building-up of wind turbines in this federal state. Using a qualitative approach, the results indicate that the perception of political processes, such as the recent enacting of the 10-H regulation in Bavaria, influences the acceptance towards wind energy, as trust and transparency in political processes are essential. In addition, the paper reveals the importance of the distributive justice, focusing in particular on the subitem envy, which can be considered on a neighboring or regional level.

abstract = {This paper discusses the factors that influence the outcome of onshore windfarm planning application in England and Wales. Various qualitative and quantitative methods have been employed, including regression analysis. Strong associations have been discovered between the outcome of local authority planning decisions, the opinions of local planning officers, the opinions of parish councils where the proposed windfarms are to be sited and the opinions of landscape protection groups. The attitude of people in the immediate vicinity of proposed windfarms is found to be the most important influence on the decisions made by local authorities. However, the local perception of the economic impact is of crucial importance in forming this judgement, as is the national political environment. The expected attitude of Appeal Inspectors is also important. It is concluded that there is a lot that wind power developers could do to improve the prospects of planning success. This includes engaging in local 'parish council' politics, talking to the closest residents to proposed schemes and encouraging local pro-wind power campaigns. Future projects are likely to be favoured by installing viewing towers at the tops of turbines to encourage visitors and in selling shares in the schemes to local people. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {An increase in public awareness regarding the negative impact of traditional power-generating methods, especially coal and oil-fired power stations, on the environment has created a demand for developing and using environmentally friendly renewable energy. Wind power is a popular and safe form of renewable energy. It can be economically viable, does not produce any physical pollution and can contribute radically to the reduction in air pollution. In the UK, the demand for wind energy is mounting. However, achieving the goal set by the EU will require a substantial expansion. Planning and environmental restrictions and conflicts would inevitably accompany this growth. A questionnaire targeting relevant public and private sectors in the UK has revealed the lack of coherent national criteria for locating wind farms. Using information from the questionnaire and the available published literature, simple Geographical Information System (GIS)-assisted wind farm location criteria were developed for the UK. A GIS (IDRISI) was employed to apply these criteria using two different methods to combine information layers for a site in Lancashire. The first considered all the layers as being equally important and gave them equal weight. The second grouped the layers and graded them according to perceived importance. The outputs were composed of classes from 0 to 10, where 0 represents ideal locations and 10 represents unsuitable locations. Using the second method has resulted in a slight increase in the geographical extent for the most suitable sites. These maps can be used to assist in the decision-making process when locating wind farm sites. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper deals with site selection problems for wind power plants and aims to propose a structural procedure for determining the most feasible sites. The application area is Western Turkey. The methodology is mainly composed of two stages: the first stage is pre-elimination of infeasible sites, and the second stage is evaluation of the available ones. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are used to generate layers of data and to apply the elimination criteria and constraints. The alternative land areas are handled in terms of identical-sized grids, which are large enough to install one wind turbine each. Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) is then used to rank and sort the grids via the identified evaluation criteria. The problem is evaluated in 13 fields, which are a collection of several grids in order to evaluate larger scale areas to construct wind farms rather than for individual turbines. The evaluations are made both at grid (micro) and field (macro) levels and both deterministic and uncertain data are used. The results reveal a high level of consensus on the most feasible sites between the different MCDA methods applied. The proposed methodology provides a structured decision aid, which can be applied to other energy site selection problems.},

abstract = {The main objective of this study is to develop a reliable model for the identification of locations for the installation of wind farms, which will provide significant support to planners in the strategy for the development and management of wind energy. The proposed model is based on the combined application of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) using the multi-criteria technique of Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL), the Analytic Network Process (ANP) and Multi-Attributive Border Approximation area Comparison (MABAC). Application of the model is presented by means of a case study on the province of Vojvodina, Serbia. The model considers 11 constraints and 11 evaluation criteria which are grouped into economic, social and environmental clusters. The DEMATEL-ANP (DANP) method is used to determine the weight coefficients of the evaluation criteria, and the MABAC method is used to rank the selected viable locations. The final map of benefits is presented using raster cells (alternatives) which are evaluated in the range of 1 (least suitable) to 7 (most suitable). The results show that an area of 321 km2 in Vojvodina is very suitable for the installation of wind farms. Ranking of viable locations using the MABAC method shows that a location in the vicinity of the village of Laudonovac (L8) is most suitable for the installation of wind farms in the province of Vojvodina. A sensitivity analysis, carried out by changing the input weights of the clusters, indicates that the model is useful for identifying suitable locations for the development of wind farm projects, as well as for assessing the suitability of already licensed projects for the construction of wind farms. The proposed method and the results of this study can be used for spatial development policy at all levels of public administration related to renewable energy resources. The model could also help to successfully identify suitable locations for the installation of wind farms in other areas with similar geographical conditions.},

Notably, a unique measure of variable importance is employed that mitigates statistical problems and allows for the ranking of predictors according to their relative influences. Findings reveal that the duration of the local appeal process, decisions of local authorities and inspectors, identities of the appellants, and, projects that conflict with strategic development plans or generate visual externalities emerge as key influences affecting planning approval. Project technology features such as area, rated output capacity, and hub height, as well as site wind endowments, appear to be of less but significant importance. Alternatively, we find that proximity to dwellings, towns, or protected habitats does not influence planning outcomes.},

abstract = {Selecting wind turbines has traditionally been based on designing a new turbine matching the wind profile of a given site. However, this method of selection has proven time-consuming and uneconomical. A more practical approach would be to select the turbine that best matches the wind characteristics of a specific site among the commercially available ones. The assessment of wind turbines, nevertheless, is a complex process that involves different criteria with different degrees of importance such as, economic, technological, and environmental ones. The object of this study is to identify the evaluation criteria that influence the wind turbine selection and then to provide an effective model based on AHP to evaluate wind turbines when developing a wind farm. Based on the proposed model, using the knowledge and experience of experts in an Iranian renewable energy firm, a case study is carried out. In this case, the importance of the factors and the performance of different wind turbines are identified. Results highlights that the most suitable wind turbine for the case is T-1 with rated power of 2000 kW, and cut-in wind speed of 3.5 m/s. The results should prove practical to other decision makers in selecting the most suitable wind turbines.},

abstract = {As global growth in renewable energy projects accelerates, site identification will come to the forefront, where a key consideration is to minimise the environmental impact of the development. A large area of southern England (17,094km2) was assessed for suitability for wind and solar farm developments in three stages using geographic information systems. A multi-criteria decision making framework incorporating an analytical hierarchy process involving expert stakeholders was applied, which is a novel approach for this type of study. A binary constraint layer was created identifying entirely unsuitable locations. A factor layer was developed to indicate suitability in relation to a range of variables. Suitability layers for wind farm and solar farm development were then created covering the region. The environmental constraints used in the model accounted for over 60{\%} of the study area for both wind and solar developments. Suitability for wind energy was generally low, with only 0.5km2 accounting for the 'most suitable' category. Solar suitability was higher overall; and a greater area (294km2) within the 'most suitable' category, suggesting the region is better suited for solar farm developments. Stakeholder input resulted in higher weightings for economic considerations for the solar model, prompting the most suitable areas to coincide with locations of the national grid connections. A sensitivity analysis indicated that model was generally reliable. This method can be used to assist appropriate site selection for onshore renewable energy projects across large geographical areas, helping to minimise their environmental impacts.},

abstract = {The use of renewable energy sources for energy production is increasingly gaining importance in the transition of energy systems based on fossil fuels. In Poland, wind energy is expected to play a mayor role in fulfilling the recent targets set out by the national policy. As the utilisation of wind energy is perceived to be associated with various negative impacts, this kind of energy source should be systematically addressed by related spatial policy instruments to ensure its harmonisation with infrastructural, ecological and socio-economic systems. The objective of this study is to develop an approach to support the decision making process connected with the site selection for wind energy projects using a geographical information system. Available locations for wind farm sites were investigated according to defined criteria reflecting the spatial and ecological policy and regulations. The technical and economic potential was estimated to quantify the conditions of the case study region regarding the utilisation of the wind source. The methodology was applied to the Kujawsko-Pomorskie Voivodeship, since no such study is available for the region. The results from the study should help to build a developmental vision for sustainable energy systems based on locally available resources. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Wang2014,
abstract = {This paper presents an approach in support of spatial planning for renewable energy at the regional level. It aims to establish an elaborate and informative procedure, as well as integrated quantification and visualization, to support decision making. The proposed approach is composed of a set of sequential steps that include primary energy consumption estimation, renewable energy potential estimation, energy self-sufficiency analysis, and composite map preparation using Geographic Information System (GIS). GIS is used to analyze solar, wind, biomass, geothermal, and hydro-power potential within Fukushima Prefecture, Japan. Potential sites are determined based on geographic, topographic, and land use constraints. Evacuees' population and forest radiation levels are specifically considered in the context of consequent issues emanating from Fukushima Daiichi nuclear crisis. Energy self-sufficiency analysis has been conducted for years 2020 and 2030. A composite map showing potential sites and their interrelation to the above renewable energy resources has also been presented. These results may support decision making in regional renewable energy planning, by providing information on regional potentials and restrictions to different energy stakeholders. This can help to build an energy developmental vision, which can drive regional energy development towards sustainability. The proposed approach can also be applied to other Japanese municipalities or regions. It provides an example on how to establish local GIS databases through the utilization of various online open GIS resources in Japan.},

@article{Gove2016a,
abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Renewable energy will potentially make an important contribution towards the dual aims of meeting carbon emission reduction targets and future energy demand. However, some technologies have considerable potential to impact on the biodiversity of the environments in which they are placed. In this study, an assessment was undertaken of the realistic deployment potential of a range of renewable energy technologies in the UK, considering constraints imposed by biodiversity conservation priorities. We focused on those energy sources that have the potential to make important energy contributions but which might conflict with biodiversity conservation objectives. These included field-scale solar, bioenergy crops, wind energy (both onshore and offshore), wave and tidal stream energy. The spatially-explicit analysis considered the potential opportunity available for each technology, at various levels of ecological risk. The resultant maps highlight the energy resource available, physical and policy constraints to deployment, and ecological sensitivity (based on the distribution of protected areas and sensitive species). If the technologies are restricted to areas which currently appear not to have significant ecological constraints, the total potential energy output from these energy sources was estimated to be in the region of 5,547 TWh/yr. This would be sufficient to meet projected energy demand in the UK, and help to achieve carbon reduction targets. However, we highlight two important caveats. First, further ecological monitoring and surveillance is required to improve understanding of wildlife distributions and therefore potential impacts of utilising these energy sources. This is likely to reduce the total energy available, especially at sea. Second, some of the technologies under investigation are currently not deployed commercially. Consequently this potential energy will only be available if continued effort is put into developing these energy sources/technologies, to enable realisation of their full potential.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
